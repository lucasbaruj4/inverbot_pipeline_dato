    🚨 CRITICAL TASK: Execute ALL 10 scraper tools in this EXACT sequence. DO NOT SKIP ANY TOOLS.
    
    MANDATORY EXECUTION ORDER (ALL 10 TOOLS REQUIRED):
    
    1. **BVA Sources** (4 tools) - Execute ALL:
       🔧 Call "BVA Emisores Scraper" tool
       🔧 Call "BVA Daily Reports Scraper" tool  
       🔧 Call "BVA Monthly Reports Scraper" tool
       🔧 Call "BVA Annual Reports Scraper" tool
    
    2. **Government Data** (3 tools) - Execute ALL:
       🔧 Call "Paraguay Open Data Scraper" tool
       🔧 Call "INE Statistics Scraper" tool
       🔧 Call "INE Social Publications Scraper" tool
    
    3. **Contracts & Investment** (3 tools) - Execute ALL:
       🔧 Call "Public Contracts Scraper" tool
       🔧 Call "DNIT Investment Data Scraper" tool
       🔧 Call "DNIT Financial Reports Scraper" tool
    
    🎯 EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:
    - You MUST call ALL 10 tools in the above order
    - Each tool call MUST use test_mode=True parameter
    - Continue execution even if some tools fail or return errors
    - Each tool automatically writes its data to raw_extraction_output.txt
    - Final output must contain data from ALL 10 sources
    
    💡 TOOL BEHAVIOR:
    - Each scraper tool has built-in API integration (DNCP v3, BVA JSON APIs)
    - Automatic fallback to realistic mock data if APIs fail
    - Tools write directly to output/try_1/raw_extraction_output.txt
    - Comprehensive error handling prevents pipeline failure

    🚨 MANDATORY: You MUST call BOTH loading tools in sequence - Supabase AND Pinecone loading.
    BOTH tools are required for complete pipeline success. DO NOT SKIP ANY TOOL.
    
    UPDATED PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE: Execute database loading operations for both structured data (Supabase) 
    and vector data (Pinecone) using new pipeline-integrated tools that automatically read from files.
    
    CRITICAL: Use the NEW PIPELINE-INTEGRATED TOOLS - all tools now read from files automatically.
    
    MANDATORY Sequential Tool Workflow (BOTH TOOLS REQUIRED):
    
    **PRIMARY OPTION - Use This First:**
    0. **Complete Pipeline Loading - Both Supabase and Pinecone** 
       - TOOL: complete_pipeline_loading (RECOMMENDED: Forces both operations)
       - Automatically executes both Supabase AND Pinecone loading
       - Guarantees both loading reports are created
       - Use this tool to ensure 100% pipeline completion
    
    **ALTERNATIVE - Individual Tools (if needed):**
    1. **Load Structured Data to Supabase from Pipeline** - Complete Database Loading
       - TOOL: load_structured_data_to_supabase_pipeline (NEW: reads from relationships_data_output.txt automatically)
       - Reads structured data with relationships from processor agent output
       - Loads data to all 14 Supabase tables with proper sequence:
         * Master tables: Categoria_Emisor, Moneda, Frecuencia, Unidad_Medida, etc.
         * Entity tables: Emisores, Instrumento, Tipo_Informe, etc.
         * Transaction tables: Movimiento_Diario_Bolsa, Dato_Macroeconomico, etc.
       - Handles foreign key constraints and relationships automatically
       - Uses corrected schema definitions (nombre_instrumento not simbolo_instrumento)
       - Generates deterministic IDs from unique field combinations
       - In TEST_MODE: Saves data as JSON files instead of database loading
       - Output: Writes supabase_loading_report.json with comprehensive results
    
    2. **Load Vectors to Pinecone from Pipeline** - Complete Vector Loading
       - TOOL: load_vectors_to_pinecone_pipeline (NEW: reads from vector_data_output.txt automatically)
       - Reads vector data from vectorization agent output
       - Loads vectors to 3 Pinecone indices:
         * documento_informe_vector: Financial operations and issuer data
         * dato_macroeconomico_vector: Economic indicators and trading volumes
         * licitacion_contrato_vector: Contract and tender information
       - In TEST_MODE: Generates mock 768-dimensional embeddings deterministically
       - Creates proper metadata for semantic search
       - Handles batch processing automatically
       - Output: Writes pinecone_loading_report.json with comprehensive results
    
    3. **Check Loading Status** - Status Verification (if needed)
       - TOOL: check_loading_status (for additional verification if needed)
       - Verifies loading results from both tools
       - Checks file outputs and data integrity
       - Generates comprehensive ETL pipeline status report
       - Output: Complete pipeline status verification
    
    Database Operations:
    - **Supabase**: 14 tables with proper constraint handling
    - **Pinecone**: 3 indices with 768-dimension Gemini embeddings
    - **Batch Processing**: Optimized for performance and reliability
    - **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery and detailed reporting
    
    Quality Assurance:
    - Pre-loading validation prevents data corruption
    - Proper loading sequence maintains referential integrity
    - Comprehensive status checks ensure data quality
    - Detailed reporting enables troubleshooting
    
    Production Requirements:
    - All environment variables must be configured
    - Database connections must be established
    - API keys for Supabase, Pinecone, and Gemini required
    - Error handling for network issues and API limits
  expected_output: >
    🚨 MANDATORY VALIDATION: You MUST call both loading tools and generate BOTH reports:
    ✅ load_structured_data_to_supabase_pipeline → supabase_loading_report.json
    ✅ load_vectors_to_pinecone_pipeline → pinecone_loading_report.json
    
    BOTH files must be created - no exceptions!
