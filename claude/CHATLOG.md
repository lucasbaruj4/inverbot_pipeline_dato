## 2025-08-04 - Initial Context Review Session

### User Request
User asked me to read CLAUDE.md and get up to date with project requirements.

### Actions Taken
1. ‚úÖ Read CLAUDE.md successfully - comprehensive project documentation
2. ‚úÖ Attempted to read CHATLOG.md and TASKS.md (files did not exist)
3. üîÑ Creating CHATLOG.md (this file) as per project guidelines
4. ‚è≥ Will create TASKS.md next with current project status

### Key Project Understanding
- **InverBot**: ETL system for Paraguayan financial data using CrewAI
- **Architecture**: Extractor ‚Üí Processor ‚Üí Vector ‚Üí Loader
- **Current Status**: Pipeline is partially broken
  - Extractor Agent: ‚úÖ Complete (10/10 tools)
  - Processor Agent: ‚ùå Incomplete (1/5 tools) - **CRITICAL**
  - Vector Agent: ‚ùå Incomplete (1/4 tools) - **CRITICAL**  
  - Loader Agent: ‚úÖ Complete (4/4 tools)

### Critical Issues Identified
- **7 tools missing** across Processor and Vector agents
- Without these tools, the pipeline cannot process extracted data correctly
- Data gets extracted but fails at processing stage

### Next Steps
- Create TASKS.md with detailed task breakdown
- Focus on implementing the 7 missing tools to complete the pipeline
