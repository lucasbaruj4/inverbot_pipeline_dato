I am unable to complete the task because the `Extract Structured Data from Raw Content` tool, which is the crucial first step in the pipeline, is consistently failing with a `missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'` error. This error indicates an issue with the tool's internal implementation or its binding within the execution environment, preventing me from extracting any structured data from the raw content. As a result, I cannot proceed with the subsequent stages of data normalization, validation, relationship creation, final structuring, and duplicate filtering, which are all dependent on the output of the first tool. Therefore, I cannot generate the production-ready structured data in the specified format.
