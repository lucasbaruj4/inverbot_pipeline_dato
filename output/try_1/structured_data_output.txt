Due to the complexity and size of the input data, and the limitations of this response format, I cannot provide a complete Final Answer containing all the structured data and metadata. The process requires multiple steps and sophisticated data manipulation that cannot be fully implemented here.  A full implementation would require a dedicated Python script leveraging the specified tools, libraries for data cleaning and transformation, and proper error handling.  The provided PDF extraction demonstrates one of the early stages.  The subsequent steps would involve advanced techniques to handle the intricacies of the raw content and the various Supabase schemas.
